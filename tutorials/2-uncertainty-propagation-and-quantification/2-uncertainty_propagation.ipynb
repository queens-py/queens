    "# Uncertainty Quantification\n",
    "\n",
    "In fields such as engineering, physics, and applied mathematics, simulation models serve as crucial tools for predicting real-world phenomena. These models typically rely on precise parameterization, including aspects like constitutive models and boundary conditions. However, in practical applications, these parameters are often unknown due to insufficient experimental data. To ensure accurate predictions despite this uncertainty, it is essential to incorporate these unknowns into the modeling process. This is precisely the focus of the field of uncertainty quantification, which aims to systematically address and manage the uncertainties inherent in simulation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll have a look at forward uncertainty quantification. Here the goal is to model the uncertainty in quantity of interest $y$ by propagating uncertainties in input $\\theta$ through the model $f(\\theta)$:\n",
    "$$u = f(\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we assume the input $\\theta$ is uncertain, which we describe with a random variable using a probability distribution $p(\\theta)$. As a consequence, the outputs of the model $m$ are random variables as well, following a distribution $p(u)$. *Random in, random out.*"

As can be observed, the distribution shows a large variance for $x_c \\approx 0.2$ and $x_c \\approx 0.5$, indicating that the solution at these locations is strongly affected by the source term. In contrast, for $x_c \\approx 0.8$, the probability mass, i.e., where $p(u_c)>0$, tends to concentrate around smaller values! Consequently, the variance of the solution at this location is much smaller."

    "# Why QUEENS?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even though Monte Carlo is a straightforward algorithm, utilizing QUEENS offers several advantages that enhance its functionality and usability. One significant benefit is that QUEENS provides various convenience functions for handling results and logging. For instance, if you check the folder `output/poisson_example`, you will find log files and result pickle files generated from the QUEENS runs. This organized output makes it easier to track and analyze the results of your simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another key advantage of QUEENS is its support for parallelism. The Monte Carlo algorithm is inherently parallelizable, meaning each model evaluation can be conducted independently of the others. In the context of these examples, setting `num_jobs=4` in the scheduler allows for the execution of four simulations simultaneously. This capability significantly speeds up the computation process, making it more efficient and effective for handling large-scale simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additionally, QUEENS offers model independence, a crucial feature for users working with various modeling frameworks. QUEENS does not require knowledge of the inner workings of the model or the specifics of libraries like scikit-fem. Instead, it seamlessly manages all the evaluation processes, allowing users to integrate their models without needing to modify QUEENS itself. "
