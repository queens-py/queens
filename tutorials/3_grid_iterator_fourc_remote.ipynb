    "Remote computing with QUEENS is enabled via SSH port forwarding, so a few initial steps are necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure both your local and your remote machine have an SSH key under `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.\n",
    "    In case either of them does not have one yet, you can generate an SSH key on the respective machine via:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    # execute on local or remote machine:\n",
    "    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connecting via SSH from the local to the remote machine needs to work without a password.   \n",
    "    Therefore, you need to copy the public key of the local machine to the `authorized_keys` file of the remote machine:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    # execute on local machine:\n",
    "    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <username>@<machine_you_would_like_to_access_passwordless>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To enable passwordless access on the remote machine itself, you also need to copy the ssh-key of the remote machine to its `authorized_keys` file:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    # execute on remote machine:\n",
    "    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Troubleshooting**:\n",
    "> If you are still asked for your password after these steps, verify that:\n",
    "> - The `~/.ssh` directory has permissions `700`.\n",
    ">   To set the permissions correctly, execute `chmod -R 700 ~/.ssh`.\n",
    "> - The home directory on you remote machine has permissions `700`.\n",
    "    To set the permissions correctly, execute `chmod 700 ~` on the remote machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Clone the QUEENS repository on the remote machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Install the same QUEENS environment with the same name that you are using on your local machine also on the remote machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Subclassing**:\n",
    "> If you run QUEENS with custom classes that inherit from QUEENS objects, you need to ensure that these classes are also available in the remote QUEENS environment.\n",
    "> You can do this in one of the following ways:\n",
    "> 1. Include the custom classes in the QUEENS repository. They will be automatically copied to the remote QUEENS repository at the start of the QUEENS runs.\n",
    "> 1. Manually synchronize the custom classes between your local and your remote machine, e.g., via an additional repository and install this repository in the remote QUEENS environment."
