        Args:
            model (Model): Model to be evaluated by iterator
            parameters (Parameters): Parameters object
            global_settings (GlobalSettings): settings of the QUEENS experiment including its name
                                              and the output directory
            initial_guess (array like): initial position at which the optimization starts
            result_description (dict): Description of desired post-processing.
            verbose_output (int): Integer encoding which kind of verbose information should be
                                  printed by the optimizers.
            bounds (sequence, Bounds): Bounds on variables for Nelder-Mead, L-BFGS-B, TNC, SLSQP,
                                       Powell, and trust-constr methods.
                                       There are two ways to specify the bounds:

                                       1. Instance of `Bounds` class.
                                       2. A sequence with 2 elements. The first element corresponds
                                       to a sequence of lower bounds and the second element to
                                       sequence of upper bounds. The length of each of the two
                                       subsequences must be equal to the number of variables.
            max_feval (int): Maximum number of function evaluations.
            algorithm (str): Algorithm to perform minimization:

                             - trf : Trust Region Reflective algorithm, particularly suitable for
                                       large sparse problems with bounds. Generally robust method.

                             - dogbox : dogleg algorithm with rectangular trust regions, typical use
                                        case is small problems with bounds. Not recommended for
                                        problems with rank-deficient Jacobian.
                             - lm : Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as implemented in MINPACK.
                                    Doesn’t handle bounds and sparse Jacobians. Usually the most
                                    efficient method for small unconstrained problems.
            jac_method (str): Method to calculate a finite difference based approximation of the
                              Jacobian matrix:

                              - '2-point': a one-sided scheme by definition
                              - '3-point': more exact but needs twice as many function evaluations
            jac_rel_step (array_like): Relative step size to use for finite difference approximation
                                       of Jacobian matrix. If None (default) then it is selected
                                       automatically. (see SciPy documentation for details)
            objective_and_jacobian (bool, opt): If true, every time the objective is evaluated also
                                                the jacobian is evaluated. This leads to improved
                                                batching, but can lead to unnecessary evaluations of
                                                the jacobian during line-search.
                                                Default is true.
