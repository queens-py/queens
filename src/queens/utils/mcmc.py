    """Perform Metropolis-Hastings selection.

    The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to
    accept or reject a proposed sample based on the log of the acceptance probability. This function
    compares the acceptance probability with a random number between 0 and 1 to decide if each
    proposed sample should replace the current sample.
    If the random number is smaller than the acceptance probability, the proposed sample is
    accepted. The function further checks whether the `log_acceptance_probability` is finite. If
    it is infinite or NaN, the function will not accept the respective proposed sample.

    Args:
        log_acceptance_probability: Logarithm of the acceptance probability for each sample. This
            represents the log of the ratio of the probability densities of the proposed sample to
            the current sample.
        current_sample: The current sample values from the MCMC chain.
        proposed_sample: The proposed sample values to be considered for acceptance.

    Returns:
        The sample values selected after the Metropolis-Hastings step.
            If the proposed sample is accepted, it will be returned; otherwise, the current sample
            is returned.
        A bool array indicating whether each proposed sample was accepted.

    r"""Adjust the covariance scaling factor based on the acceptance rate.

    This function tunes the covariance scaling factor used in Metropolis-Hastings or similar MCMC
    algorithms based on the observed acceptance rate of proposed samples. The goal is to maintain an
    acceptance rate within the range of 20% to 50%, which is considered optimal for many MCMC
    algorithms. The covariance scaling factor is adjusted according to the following rules:

        +------------------+-----------------------------+
        | Acceptance Rate  |  Variance adaptation factor |
        +==================+=============================+
        |     <0.001       |              x 0.1          |
